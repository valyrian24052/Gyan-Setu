# OpenAI Fine-Tuning

OpenAI Fine-Tuning involves deep fine-tuning of OpenAI's models through their official API to better align them with educational requirements.

## What It Is

OpenAI Fine-Tuning involves deep fine-tuning of OpenAI's models (like GPT-3.5-Turbo) using their official API. This method modifies the actual weights of the model to better align with your specific educational use cases.

## How It Contributes to the Application

- **Domain Adaptation**: Tailors the model to your specific educational domain and terminology
- **Consistent Responses**: Improves consistency in how the chatbot responds
- **Reduced Prompt Length**: Fine-tuned models often need less context in prompts
- **Cost Efficiency**: Can reduce token usage and API costs for high-volume applications

## Advanced Educational Knowledge

OpenAI Fine-Tuning allows the framework to build specialized educational models that have deep understanding of:

- **Educational Standards**: Aligning responses with curriculum standards and educational benchmarks
- **Pedagogical Best Practices**: Incorporating proven teaching techniques and classroom management strategies
- **Assessment Methods**: Improving how the chatbot evaluates and provides feedback on teaching approaches

## Practical Impact

In the LLM Chatbot Framework, OpenAI Fine-Tuning:

1. **Enables Specialized Educational Assistants**: Creates models focused on specific educational domains
2. **Improves Consistency**: Ensures responses follow educational best practices consistently
3. **Reduces Token Usage**: Fine-tuned models often require less context/instruction, reducing API costs
4. **Streamlines Deployment**: Simplifies system architecture by embedding more knowledge in the model itself

## Implementation Details

The OpenAI fine-tuning integration is implemented in `src/llm/fine_tuning/openai_tuner.py` and provides:

- `prepare_data()`: Formats training data for OpenAI's requirements
- `start_fine_tuning()`: Initiates a fine-tuning job with OpenAI
- `check_status()`: Monitors the progress of fine-tuning jobs
- `list_jobs()`: Lists all fine-tuning jobs
- `list_models()`: Lists available fine-tuned models
- `create_fine_tuned_handler()`: Creates a handler using the fine-tuned model

## Example Usage

```python
from src.llm.fine_tuning.openai_tuner import OpenAIFineTuner

# Initialize the tuner
tuner = OpenAIFineTuner()

# Prepare a training file (or use an existing one)
training_file = "cache/fine_tuning/education_examples.jsonl"

# Start fine-tuning
job_id = tuner.start_fine_tuning(
    training_file=training_file,
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    suffix="edu-assistant"
)

# Check status (later)
status = tuner.check_status(job_id)
print(f"Job status: {status}")

# Create a handler using the fine-tuned model
if status == "succeeded":
    model_id = tuner.get_model_id(job_id)
    handler = tuner.create_fine_tuned_handler(model_id)
```

## Code Integration

The OpenAI fine-tuning integration provides a seamless way to use fine-tuned models in the existing framework:

```python
# Example from the framework showing fine-tuned model integration
tuner = OpenAIFineTuner()
handler = tuner.create_fine_tuned_handler("ft:gpt-3.5-turbo:education-assistant")
# The handler can be used as a drop-in replacement for standard handlers
```

## Using with the CLI Tool

The framework includes a CLI tool for OpenAI fine-tuning:

```bash
# Start a fine-tuning job
python tools/fine_tuning_cli.py openai start --training-file data.jsonl --model gpt-3.5-turbo

# List jobs
python tools/fine_tuning_cli.py openai list-jobs

# Check job status
python tools/fine_tuning_cli.py openai status --job-id ft-job-123456

# List fine-tuned models
python tools/fine_tuning_cli.py openai list-models
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues with OpenAI fine-tuning:

- **API Key Errors**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is set correctly
- **File Format Errors**: Verify your JSONL file follows OpenAI's format requirements
- **Cost Management**: Monitor usage to avoid unexpected charges
- **Timeout Errors**: For large jobs, use async monitoring instead of waiting
