# Fine-Tuning Best Practices

This page provides best practices for using the fine-tuning capabilities in the LLM Chatbot Framework, focusing on when to use each method and how to ensure high-quality results.

## Choosing the Right Fine-Tuning Method

### When to Use DSPy Optimization

DSPy Optimization is ideal for:

- **Limited Training Data**: When you have only 5-20 high-quality examples
- **Quick Adaptation**: When you need results quickly without extensive training
- **Low Resource Requirements**: When you don't have access to GPU resources
- **Iterative Development**: During the early development phase to test approaches
- **Small Tweaks**: For minor adjustments to model behavior
- **Specific Educational Tasks**: For specialized classroom scenarios or Q&A improvements

### When to Use OpenAI Fine-Tuning

OpenAI Fine-Tuning is best for:

- **Medium-Sized Datasets**: When you have 50-1000 training examples
- **Consistent Responses**: When response consistency is critical
- **Educational Standards Alignment**: To align responses with specific curriculum requirements
- **Managed Infrastructure**: When you prefer not to manage infrastructure
- **Controlled API Costs**: For applications where controlling token usage is important
- **Wide Deployment**: For applications that will be widely deployed

### When to Use HuggingFace Fine-Tuning

HuggingFace Fine-Tuning is optimal for:

- **Large Datasets**: When you have 1000+ training examples
- **Privacy Requirements**: When data privacy is a critical concern
- **Offline Deployment**: For educational environments with limited connectivity
- **Full Control**: When you need complete control over model behavior
- **Cost Control**: To eliminate ongoing API costs
- **Specialized Models**: For highly specialized educational models
- **Local Infrastructure**: When you have access to GPU resources

## Training Data Quality Guidelines

For all fine-tuning approaches, the quality of training data is crucial:

### Consistency

- **Formatting**: Use consistent formatting across all examples
- **Style**: Maintain a consistent writing style and tone
- **Length**: Keep similar length and detail level in responses
- **Terminology**: Use domain-specific terminology consistently

### Diversity

- **Cover All Topics**: Include examples from all relevant educational subjects
- **Varied Questions**: Include different question types (factual, conceptual, analytical)
- **Different Scenarios**: Cover various classroom scenarios and teaching contexts
- **Edge Cases**: Include examples of unusual or edge case questions

### Quality

- **Accuracy**: Ensure all information is factually correct and up-to-date
- **Pedagogical Value**: Responses should demonstrate good teaching practices
- **Clarity**: Explanations should be clear and easy to understand
- **Age-Appropriate**: Content should be appropriate for the target age group

### Structure

- **Input-Output Pairs**: Ensure clear distinction between inputs and expected outputs
- **Context Inclusion**: Include relevant context when needed
- **Metadata**: Consider adding metadata like grade level, subject, or difficulty

## Optimizing Performance

### DSPy Optimization

- **Try Multiple Methods**: Test different optimization methods (BootstrapFewShot, BootstrapIterative)
- **Evaluate Results**: Use evaluation metrics to compare different optimized modules
- **Combine Methods**: Sometimes combining optimization approaches yields better results
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use the results to create better examples for the next optimization round

### OpenAI Fine-Tuning

- **Validation Split**: Use a validation file to monitor overfitting
- **Hyperparameters**: Experiment with batch size and learning rate multiplier 
- **Model Selection**: Try different base models (gpt-3.5-turbo vs. older models)
- **Incremental Training**: Start with a smaller dataset, then expand
- **Cost Control**: Use shorter examples when possible to minimize token costs

### HuggingFace Fine-Tuning

- **Quantization**: Use 4-bit or 8-bit quantization for larger models
- **LoRA Parameters**: Experiment with LoRA rank and alpha parameters
- **Learning Rate**: Test different learning rates (typically between 1e-5 and 5e-5)
- **Batch Size**: Adjust batch size based on available GPU memory
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Use gradient accumulation for effectively larger batch sizes
- **Early Stopping**: Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting

## Integration with the Framework

For best results when integrating fine-tuned models with the framework:

- **Handler Consistency**: Ensure all model handlers maintain the same interface
- **LLM Settings**: Adjust temperature, max tokens, and other settings appropriately
- **Vector Database Integration**: Re-index embeddings when changing models
- **Testing**: Test fine-tuned models thoroughly before deployment
- **Versioning**: Keep track of model versions and training data
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring to track performance in production

## Educational Domain Considerations

For educational applications, consider these domain-specific best practices:

- **Grade Level Adaptation**: Fine-tune separate models for different grade levels
- **Subject-Specific Models**: Create specialized models for different subjects
- **Pedagogical Frameworks**: Align with specific teaching methodologies
- **Assessment Integration**: Include examples that demonstrate effective assessment
- **Feedback Quality**: Emphasize constructive feedback in training examples
- **Student Engagement**: Include examples that promote student engagement
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Ensure training data is culturally sensitive and inclusive

## Resource Management

- **Cost Tracking**: Maintain a log of API costs for OpenAI fine-tuning
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Plan GPU requirements for HuggingFace fine-tuning
- **Disk Space**: Ensure sufficient disk space for model weights (especially for larger models)
- **Batching**: Batch fine-tuning jobs to optimize resource usage
- **Caching**: Cache optimized DSPy modules to avoid repeated optimization
