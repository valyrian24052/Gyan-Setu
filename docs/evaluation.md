## Evaluation Components

The evaluation system consists of three main components:

1. **Automated Metrics Evaluator**
   - Real-time analysis of teaching responses
   - Context-aware evaluation considering student profiles and scenarios
   - Integration with language models for natural language understanding

2. **Multi-dimensional Assessment**
   - Six key dimensions of teaching effectiveness
   - Numerical scoring system (1-10 scale)
   - Weighted scoring for overall effectiveness

3. **Feedback Generation**
   - Specific strengths identification
   - Areas for improvement
   - Actionable recommendations
   - Visual representation of results
