Now you try! Show me an acute angle with your arms... [Student demonstrates] Great! Now let's use these protractors to measure the angles in these shapes..."

As the droplets get bigger, they'll start to fall - that's precipitation, like rain. The water collects at the bottom - like lakes and oceans - and then the cycle starts again. Let's draw this cycle and label each phase."
