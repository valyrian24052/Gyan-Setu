# Teacher Training System Example

This directory contains a complete implementation of an Enhanced Teacher Training System, which serves as a case study for the LLM-based chatbot development framework.

## Overview

The Teacher Training System provides realistic classroom management scenarios for elementary education teachers. It demonstrates how domain-specific knowledge (educational research) can be integrated with LLMs to create a specialized application.

## Key Components

- **Scenario Generator**: Creates realistic classroom scenarios based on educational research
- **Evaluator**: Provides evidence-based feedback on teacher responses
- **Student Simulation**: Simulates realistic student behaviors and responses
- **Run Script**: Main entry point to run the teacher training application

## How to Run

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m examples.teacher_training.run
```

## How It Works

1. **Knowledge Retrieval**: The system retrieves relevant educational knowledge from the vector database
2. **Scenario Generation**: It creates realistic classroom scenarios based on this knowledge
3. **Teacher Interaction**: Teachers respond to the scenarios
4. **Evidence-Based Feedback**: The system evaluates responses using educational best practices
5. **Performance Tracking**: The system tracks which knowledge sources are most effective

## Customization

You can customize the teacher training system by:

1. Adding more educational books to the knowledge base
2. Modifying the scenario generation parameters
3. Adjusting the evaluation criteria
4. Creating new student profiles
